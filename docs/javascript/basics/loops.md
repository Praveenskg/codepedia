# Loops

Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times based on a condition.

## ðŸ“˜ Basic Loop Types in JavaScript

### 1. `for` Loop

Use when you know how many times to iterate.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Count:", i);
}
```

**Output**
```
Count: 0
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
```

---

### 2. `while` Loop

Use when the number of iterations is unknown, but based on a condition.

```js
let i = 0;
while (i < 3) {
  console.log("While loop:", i);
  i++;
}
```

---

### 3. `do...while` Loop

Runs **at least once**, even if the condition is false.

```js
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log("Do-While loop:", i);
  i++;
} while (i < 2);
```

---

### 4. `for...of` Loop

Use to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, etc.

```js
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];
for (const fruit of fruits) {
  console.log(fruit);
}
```

---

### 5. `for...in` Loop

Use to iterate over object keys (not recommended for arrays).

```js
const person = { name: "Praveen", age: 25 };

for (const key in person) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
}
```

## ðŸ”„ Loop Control Statements

- **`break`** â€“ exits the loop early
- **`continue`** â€“ skips to the next iteration

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) continue;
  console.log(i); // Skips 3
}
```
